# Card-Games-On-Motorcycles
This is a project designed to remedy my dissapoint with the Yu-Gi-Oh 5d's video games for the Nintendo DS. Despite a prominent feature of the anime they are based upon being playing cards while riding high-speed motorcycles, the games only allowed for racing, or playing cards, but not both at the same time. Well, now's your chance to see just how good you are at multitasking!

This game is made using Ursina, a framework built on top of Panda3D, using the Python language. The assets are not mine, and their sources can be found in the credits file. All I did was use Blender's triangulation modification so that Ursina would load them correctly.
