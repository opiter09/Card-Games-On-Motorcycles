# Card-Games-On-Motorcycles
This is a project designed to remedy my disappointment with the Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's video games for the Nintendo DS. Despite a prominent feature of the anime they are based 
upon being playing cards while riding high-speed motorcycles, the games only allowed for racing, or playing cards, but not both at the same time. Well, now's your chance 
to see just how good you are at multitasking!

This game is made using Ursina (https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina), a framework built on top of Panda3D, using the Python language. The assets are not mine, and their 
sources can be found in the credits file.

This repo is extremely WIP, and honestly it currently exists just to back the code up more so than to garner any feedback or the like. When the game is in a playable 
state, I plan on releasing it on itch.io (for free, to be clear).
