The motorcycle with the red part was made by panosdalk, and can be found at
https://free3d.com/3d-model/simple-motorcycle-2-981288.html. The blue one is
just a simple recolor of that done by me.

The other racing assets come from OpenGL Racing Game Prototype, a simple
engine for making racing games. It can be found at
https://github.com/Mikepicker/opengl-racing.

The assets had to be modified in Blender to all be triangulated. If done
manually this would not merit much discussion, however I was able to
automate the process (well, except for the motorcycles, which were a pain to do
and why I looked into this) using a Blender python script made by mfirmin.
It can be found at

For Windows users who want to use this script, do note that you will need to replace
all "/" in the code with "\\"; in general, you need to get rid of 
"materials = False" at the bottom if your models used materials files like mine.

The actual card art is poorly done by me, but the card rectangles, zone rectangles,
etc. come from the Fantasy Card Assets by cafeDraw. This asset pack can be found at
https://cafedraw.itch.io/fantasy-card-assets

The board the cards are played on comes from the 2D Chess Pack by Screaming Brain
Studios. It can be found at https://screamingbrainstudios.itch.io/isometric-chess
