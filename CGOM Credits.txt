The motorcycle with the red part was made by panosdalk, and can be found at
https://free3d.com/3d-model/simple-motorcycle-2-981288.html. The blue one is
just a simple recolor of that done by me.

The other racing assets come from OpenGL Racing Game Prototype, a simple
engine for making racing games. It can be found at
https://github.com/Mikepicker/opengl-racing.

All the card game stuff was made by me, hence why it is all text and straight
lines and stuff.
